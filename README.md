# Assignment_0

## Overview
This assignment asks students to implement a function in Python and check it with unit tests.

- `assignment.py`: Implement the function `sum_of_3(a, b, c)`.
- `unit_tests.py`: Run these tests to verify your implementation.

## Instructions

1. Implement `sum_of_3(a, b, c)` in `assignment.py`.

2. Run the tests locally:
   ```bash
   python unit_tests.py
   ```

   Make sure all tests pass before you submit.

3. Commit and push your solution to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add assignment.py
   git commit -m "Implement sum_of_3"
   git push
   ```

   The remote repository is already configured for you when you accept the assignment link in GitHub Classroom.

4. Automatic grading

   After you push your code, GitHub Classroom will automatically run the grading tests on your submission.
   You don’t need to trigger anything manually.
   Once grading finishes, you can see the result in GitHub Classroom and the test run details in the "Actions" tab of your repository.
